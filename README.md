Feedback:
Immediate feedback is provided to the user for each question (correct or incorrect).
Final Score Summary:
At the end of the quiz, the program displays the user's total score.
Implementation Details:

Data Structure:
Use a struct or a class to store each question's text, options, and correct answer.
Store all questions in an array or vector.
Logic Flow:

Check if the answer is correct, update the score, and provide feedback.
Error Handling:
